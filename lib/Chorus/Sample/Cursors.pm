  Here is an example trying to illustrate how a Chorus::Engine works.
  Rules are just perl functions called in an infinite loop until one of them declares its agent solved.
  Each rule is tested with a combinaison of scope(s) of one or more parameters.

  The knowledge of the system is modelized with Chorus::Frame objects. This is not necessary
  since a rule can combinate any array given in its parameter _SCOPE but, the usage of the function fmatch(),
  combinated with grep, can be an efficient way to reduce and optimize the scopes of rules parameters by
  looking for elements of knowledge having certain properties.
  In the same time (not in this example), any invocation of the frame method set() inside a rule, 
  can take advantage of the presence of the slot _BEFORE or _AFTER, to respectively try to realize 
  conditions (backward chaining) before allowing a mofification of frame or/and propagate (~ forward chaining)
  the modification to the system - See Chorus::Frame documentation. 

  In the example, the system is composed of 100 cursors (frames), each one having a slot 'level' 
  with a random value (from 1 to 10).
  The goal is to move the system until the average distance of 'level' to the medium value 5 
  is lower than 0.5.
  
  Rule 1 : display the state of the system
  Rule 2 : check if the target is reached (will declare the system as solved)
  Rule 3 : decrease levels if > 5
  Rule 4 : increase levels if < 5
  
  Of course, such a system doesn't need an expert system to be solved but it can illustrate how Chorus::Expert works.
